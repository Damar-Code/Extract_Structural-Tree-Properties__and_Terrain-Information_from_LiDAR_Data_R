LiDAR_Implimentation_to_Identify_The_Best_Perfoming_Trees_and_Providing_The_Terrain_Information_R

In a traditional way forest inventory was done by intensive sampling field survey inventory. Forest inventory provide structural tree information, such as heigh and diameter at breast height (DBH) because those two kind of data is easier to measure and have strong relationship with volume, which is importance for management. However the sampling method only cover 2% in each compartment and frequently cannot represent the real condition because the blank spot on particular place cannot be capture. Moreover, traditional forest inventory time-consuming and labor intensive.

Nowdays, LiDAR considered as the most edvance technology for forest inventory, because it is full sensus, accurate, cost saving and provide eficient workflow. This study shows the fundamental LiDAR application in forest inventory to provide the structural tree information such as, heigh, DBH, BAHA, volume, and additional terrain information. Spesifically in this study having aother purposes to find the best indivual tree with heigh peformance.

Figure 1. Workflow of LiDAR Impelmentation in Forest Inentory

All process in the workflow above was already automated. It is only required the plantation boundary, structural tree models and LiDAR point cloud data with standard naming, include the name of compartment, flight date, and pilot. After putting the point cloud data in the input folder, the R code will run and all the result will distribute and store in particular folder automatically.
